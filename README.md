DarkWebEye uses the Ahmia search engine to provide a streamlined way to find specific content on the dark web. It's perfect for cybersecurity enthusiasts, ethical hackers, and researchers.

Why DarkWebEye?
The dark web is a mysterious and often misunderstood part of the internet. With DarkWebEye, you can navigate this complex landscape responsibly. Whether you want to understand hidden services, gather research data, or satisfy your curiosity, DarkWebEye is your reliable guide.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate through the dark web with a simple and intuitive command-line interface.

## How It Works

DarkWebEye begins by ensuring you have all the required modules installed in a virtual environment. If not, it guides you through the setup process. Once everything is in place, you can enter your search query and select a time filter (e.g., Any Time, Last Day, Last Week, Last Month). The results are displayed directly in your terminal, and you have the option to save them in your preferred format.

    - Review the search results directly in your terminal.
    - Choose a file format to save the results (TXT, JSON, or PDF) or opt not to save them.

4. **Saving Results**:
    - Specify the directory where you want to save the results.
    - DarkWebEye generates the file and stores it in your specified location.
